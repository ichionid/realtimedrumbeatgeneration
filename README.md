realtimedrumbeatgeneration
==========================

The goal of this project is the application of variable order Markov-chains and rhythm automata for composing drum patterns. With the use of Markov models, I attempt to test the behaviour of a machine learning technique in the context of rhythm composition. Utilizing rhythm automata I am experimenting with the application of a rule- based pattern evolving technique for rhythm generation. The implementation language is C++
